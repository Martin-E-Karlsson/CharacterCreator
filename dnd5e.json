You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.\n\nWhile you are transformed, the following rules apply:\n\n    -Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.\n    -When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed.

Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\n\nSpellcasting Ability\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\n\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\n\nSpellcasting Focus\nYou can use a holy symbol (see the Adventuring Gear section) as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells."

You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\n\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\n\nSpellcasting Focus\nYou can use an arcane focus (see the Adventuring Gear section) as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells."

A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.\n\nAgonizing Blast\nPrerequisite: eldritch blast cantrip\nWhen you cast eldritch blast, add your Charisma modifier to the damage it deals on a hit.\n\nArmor of Shadows\nYou can cast mage armor on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.\n\nAscendant Step\nPrerequisite: 9th level\nYou can cast levitate on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.\n\nBeast Speech\nYou can cast speak with animals at will, without expending a spell slot.\n\nBeguiling Influence\nYou gain proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills.\n\nBewitching Whispers\nPrerequisite: 7th level\nYou can cast compulsion once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.\n\nBook of Ancient Secrets\nPrerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature\nYou can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class’s spell list (the two needn’t be from the same list). The spells appear in the book and don’t count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can’t cast the spells except as rituals, unless you’ve learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.\n\nOn your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell’s level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.\n\nChains of Carceri\nPrerequisite: 15th level, Pact of the Chain feature\nYou can cast hold monster at will — targeting a celestial, fiend, or elemental — without expending a spell slot or material components. You must finish a long rest before you can use this invocation on the same creature again.\n\nDevil’s Sight\nYou can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.\n\nDreadful Word\nPrerequisite: 7th level\nYou can cast confusion once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.\n\nEldritch Sight\nYou can cast detect magic at will, without expending a spell slot.\n\nEldritch Spear\nPrerequisite: eldritch blast cantrip\nWhen you cast eldritch blast, its range is 300 feet.\n\nEyes of the Rune Keeper\nYou can read all writing.\n\nFiendish Vigor\nYou can cast false life on yourself at will as a 1st-level spell, without expending a spell slot or material components.\n\nGaze of Two Minds\nYou can use your action to touch a willing humanoid and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the other creature’s senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.\n\nLifedrinker\nPrerequisite: 12th level, Pact of the Blade feature\nWhen you hit a creature with your pact weapon, the creature takes extra necrotic damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).\n\nMask of Many Faces\nYou can cast disguise self at will, without expending a spell slot.\n\nMaster of Myriad Forms\nPrerequisite: 15th level\nYou can cast alter self at will, without expending a spell slot.\n\nMinions of Chaos\nPrerequisite: 9th level\nYou can cast conjure elemental once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.\n\nMire the Mind\nPrerequisite: 5th level\nYou can cast slow once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.\n\nMisty Visions\nYou can cast silent image at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.\n\nOne with Shadows\nPrerequisite: 5th level\nWhen you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to become invisible until you move or take an action or a reaction.\n\nOtherworldly Leap\nPrerequisite: 9th level\nYou can cast jump on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.\n\nRepelling Blast\nPrerequisite: eldritch blast cantrip\nWhen you hit a creature with eldritch blast, you can push the creature up to 10 feet away from you in a straight line.\n\nSculptor of Flesh\nPrerequisite: 7th level\nYou can cast polymorph once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.\n\nSign of Ill Omen\nPrerequisite: 5th level\nYou can cast bestow curse once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.\n\nThief of Five Fates\nYou can cast bane once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.\n\nThirsting Blade\nPrerequisite: 5th level, Pact of the Blade feature\nYou can attack with your pact weapon twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\n\nVisions of Distant Realms\nPrerequisite: 15th level\nYou can cast arcane eye at will, without expending a spell slot.\n\nVoice of the Chain Master\nPrerequisite: Pact of the Chain feature\nYou can communicate telepathically with your familiar and perceive through your familiar’s senses as long as you are on the same plane of existence. Additionally, while perceiving through your familiar’s senses, you can also speak through your familiar in your own voice, even if your familiar is normally incapable of speech.\n\nWhispers of the Grave\nPrerequisite: 9th level\nYou can cast speak with dead at will, without expending a spell slot.\n\nWitch Sight\nPrerequisite: 15th level\nYou can see the true form of any shapechanger or creature concealed by illusion or transmutation magic while the creature is within 30 feet of you and within line of sight."

You gain one of the following features of your choice.\n\nPact of the Blade\nYou can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it (see the Weapons section for weapon options). You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.\n\nYour pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.\n\nYou can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.\n\nPact of the Chain\nYou learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known.\n\nWhen you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.\n\nAdditionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack with its reaction.\n\nPact of the Tome\nYour patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class’s spell list (the three needn’t be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don’t count against your number of cantrips known. If they don’t appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.\n\nIf you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die."

Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.\n\nFor example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.",
          "Spellcasting": "As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the wizard spell list.\n\nCantrips\nAt 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.\n\nSpellbook\nAt 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.\n\nPreparing and Casting Spells\nThe Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nYou prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\nFor example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\n\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\n\nSpellcasting Ability\nIntelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\n\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\n\nRitual Casting\nYou can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.\n\nSpellcasting Focus\nYou can use an arcane focus (see the Adventuring Gear section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.\n\nLearning Spells of 1st Level and Higher\nEach time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar below).\n\n\n    YOUR SPELLBOOK\n\n    The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.\n\n    Copying a Spell into the Book\n\tWhen you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.\n\n    Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.\n\n    For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.\n\n    Replacing the Book\n\tYou can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.\n\n    If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.\n\n    The Book’s Appearance\n\tYour spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.\n"
